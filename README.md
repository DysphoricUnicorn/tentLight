# TentLight

A quickly hacked together lighting system for a tent because I realized we need one three days before CCCamp started.
Running on a cheap ESP32-C3 dev board I got from aliexpress that doesn't implement USB correctly for some reason.

This code was mostly adapted from binaryDiv's [Hacking in Parallel badge project](https://github.com/binaryDiv/hip-badge-micropython).
